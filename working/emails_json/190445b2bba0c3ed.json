    "body": "Dear Insurance Company,\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the short version: I reached for a jar of spaghetti sauce on the top shelf, but it had other ideas. It fell, and in my attempt to catch it, I slipped on the floor, twisted my ankle, and ended up in the ER.\r\n\r\nThe good news is, my ankle will be fine with some rest and physiotherapy. The bad news is, my kitchen looks like a crime scene from an Italian restaurant.\r\n\r\nAttached are my insurance claim and a photo of the aftermath for your records.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nK. Singh\r\n\r\nPolicy Number: ABC987654\r\n\r\n\r\n",
